Three simple games: Tic tac toe, checkers and connect 4

These games have been developed with a (poor) self-taught knowledge of Java, using some resources from the java 101 course from Carnegie Mellon University.
Feel free to try and play or contribute. Some of the games are actually unfinished, and the graphics are pretty poor.
Have fun!
